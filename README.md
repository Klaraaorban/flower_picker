# ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸Flower PickerðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸

This project allows you to interact with a flower picker where flowers are generated by clicking on the screen. After 30 flowers are created, a series of special messages will appear. The interactive experience includes clickable flowers that change in shape, size, and color, along with animations when triggered.

The idea was to practice my JavaScript, HTML and CSS knowledge in a fun way ;))

## Features:
- Click anywhere on the screen to create flowers with random shapes, sizes, and colors.
- After creating 30 flowers, special messages appear sequentially.
